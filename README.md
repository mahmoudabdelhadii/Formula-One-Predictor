## Introduction
To introduce the problem, my goal is to build and train a neural network to predict the race winner
for each race during each season. with the winner being the driver that has the highest probability to
win each race.

In the context of tuning the hyper-parameters for the neural network, I will be using Weights and
Biases API to change the parameters of the neural network to try and find the one with the lowest
loss.

## Data extraction
To get the data needed for my data set, I used the Ergast API to collect data on the previous seasons,
specifically from 2000 to 2021. for the missing data such as qualifying time, I used and HTML parser
to get data from the official F1 website archives. Finally, for the weather, I used the wikipedia url for
the races to get data on the weather on the day of the race.
I saved all the dataframes into a .csv files so I would not need to recollect the data every runtime.
## Data engineering
To get the data ready to be used as training data for the neural network, first I joined all the data into
one data frame.
I then calculated the age of the drivers instead of date of birth and dropped the date of birth column.
to get the qualifying times from minutes and seconds to just seconds (from X:XX.XXX to the form
XX.XXX) so they can be compared better, we also calculated the cumulative difference in qualifying
times so we know by how much faster the first car on the grid is compared to the other ones for each
race.
Finally, I converted categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables to use as training and testing
data.

I used data from the year 2000 to the year 2019 as my training data, and the year 2020 and 2021 as
my testing data.

## Building the networks
I build 2 approaches that reach the same goal, one that I made the model from scratch using Pytorch
modules, and the second by training an MLPclassifier with my training data.
### neural network classifier using Pytorch.nn modules
For this network, I used 4 linear layers, 1 dropout layer, Identity activation and softmax as my
activation to get the probabilities of each driver winning and losing each race between zero and one.
I then used Weights and Biases API to tune my hyper parameters to this network and varied the hyper
parameters according to table 1 below.

First layer size 65,70,75,80
Second layer size 15,20,25,30
Third layer size 40,50,60
Fourth layer size 5,8,10
Dropout probability 0.1 - 0.3
Learning rate 0 - 0.1 uniform

With the hyper parameters, I used a random sweep and measured the training loss of the model,
validation loss , and validation accuracy. my metric used to evaluate the models was cross varied
using WandB API and the APIâ€™s goal is to minimize the loss.
### neural network classifier using MLPclassifier module
For this network, I used the MLPclassifier framework provided by Pytorch, I converted my data
frame to a Numpy array and used the array to fit the model, I them used the fitted model to predict
the 2020 and 2021 races.

## Models Evaluation
The way each model was evaluated was by selecting each driver in each circuit in the season,
calculating the probability of each driver winning in that circuit, and then organizing the drivers
in descending order of probabilities, where the podium (winner) is the driver that has the highest
probability of winning that race, and second, third, forth etc.. is what follows that winning driver in
order of probability.

## Results
Overall, my models showed success in either one of the 2020 season or the 2021 season, however,
due to the limitations and unpredictability of motor racing, crashes, safety cars and regulation
changes, I was unable to get a model that was more that 60% accurate for both seasons.
Furthermore, the regulations changed between 2020 and 2021, more specifically, a cost cap was
introduced between the 2020 and 2021 season. Cars for each constructor agreed that the budget for
the development & manufacturing of cars for 2021 will be lowered from the original figure of $175m
per year to $145m, with further reductions in the following years.
The FIA has also approved a measure to limit downforce on the 2021 cars. The new rule means teams
will have to trim part of the floor to reduce the downforce created, largely so a new tyre compound
will not be needed for next season, before a switch to 18 inch tyres in 2022.
Lastly, From the beginning of the 2021 season, there will be a limitation on the number of upgrades a
power unit manufacturer can do over the course of a season and the minimum weight increases 3kg
to 749kg.

These new regulations evened the playing field for constructors that are at the bottom of the grid,
hence why I was unable to get a model that was more than 60% accurate in predicting the podium for
each race in the season for 2020 and 2021. FIA simply introduced a new playing field for motor
racing and made it easier for bottom-tier teams to compete.
Finally, if you, the reader, do watch Formula One, you would be aware of the unpredictability of the
2021 season. Especially the absurd violations that race control awarded to some drivers on the grid.
The race director, Michael Massi, was actually asked to step down over the unfair advantages he
awarded some constructors on the grid.
All the above points introduced limitations into my machine learning models, where the model is
trained for races with very similar regulations, and then tested on a season where regulations change,
causing the accuracy to drop around 14%.
